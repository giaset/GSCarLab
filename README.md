# AppCoreKit Samples

This repository propose a bunch of samples on how to use the AppCoreKit Framework.
AppCoreKit is an application framework designed to improve productivity while creating Apps for iOS. This is the result of a 3 years experience at Wherecloud and is a production framework that shipped more than 20 apps.

AppCoreKit do not offers out of the box UI components but the technology to help you manage your data, automatic serialization, type conversions, network, view controllers, ui vs. models synchronization, appearance customization, responsive view layouts, forms, maps, objective-C runtime apis and more.

Keep in mind that AppCoreKit is a toolbox. It is non intrusive so that you can cherry pick features and learn how to use it at your own pace.
